BoB! turns a simple container instanciation into a power support tool for general troubleshooting, service rendering, and performance evaluation.  It does this by creating a core set services that house and manage the utilities as well as a super lightweight container to invoke in a pod.

BoB! integrates deeply into cloud native environments leveraging extension points and providing a seamless experience.
