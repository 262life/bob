# What is Bash on board! (we like to call it BOB)?

BOB is an open source **general purpose container** for Kubernetes, providing the utilities, support tools and a framework, that allows a diverse set problems to be solved for pod initialization and support to natively integrate with cloud-native environments.

BOB turns a simple container instantiation into a power support tool for general troubleshooting, service rendering, and performance evaluation.  It does this by creating a core set services that house and manage the utilities as well as a super lightweight container to invoke in a pod.  

BOB integrates deeply into cloud native environments leveraging extension points and providing a seamless experience for scheduling, lifecycle management, resource management, security, monitoring, and user experience.
